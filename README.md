# `libray`

School Rust project to implement a ray-tracing library

It uses a previous library to handle and save `ppm` files.

It also uses the rayon package to parallelize ray computing trough threads and improve global speed.

The lib is accessible through the description of a scene send in a json file.

An example is available, to try it, just run:

    cd examples && cargo run src/test.json out.ppm

The first time it will build the library but when executed again, it will just compute the scene.
